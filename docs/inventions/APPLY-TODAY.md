Subject: Grant Application - LUXBIN Temporal Blockchain

Hi Web3 Foundation Grants Team,

I'm Nichole Christie, and I've just submitted a grant application
for LUXBIN - a Substrate blockchain featuring temporal cryptography.

Key innovations:
• Proof-of-Time consensus (99% energy reduction vs Bitcoin)
• Temporal cryptography for time-based security
• Decentralized AI compute marketplace
• Photonic address encoding (HSL colors)

Working testnet deployed: 1800+ blocks produced
GitHub: https://github.com/nichechristie/luxbin-chain

I've built the entire stack on Substrate and am seeking $100k
to complete security audit preparation, Rococo deployment, and
community testing.

Looking forward to your review!

Best regards,
Nichole Christie
