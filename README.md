## Troubleshooting & Video Tips

- If embedded videos do not play in README: try opening the raw MP4 link directly.
- For consistent playback across browsers and GitHub, consider:
  - Converting short clips to GIFs for inline visuals.
  - Hosting the full MP4s on a CDN, S3, or YouTube and linking/embedding thumbnails.
  - Creating release assets and linking to them.
