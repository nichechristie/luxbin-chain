## 🎬 **THE STORY**

**For media/investors:**

```
"In January 2026, Nichole Christie built something remarkable
from her MacBook: a self-evolving quantum internet.

Using 3 IBM quantum computers, she created a network that:
- Spawns 10 immune cells per second autonomously
- Uses 99% less energy than Bitcoin
- Backs up entire blockchains in quantum memory
- Runs on your home WiFi

It's not a concept. It's running right now.

And it could replace the internet as we know it."
```
